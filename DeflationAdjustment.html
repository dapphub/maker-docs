Continuous and automatic adjustments of the DeflationRate are done in
order to cause the DaiMarketPrice to stabilize around the TargetPrice.

After some time dt, the new deflation rate DR' is calculated as

                DR' = DR + sgn(TP - MP) * SP * dt,

where DR is the previous deflation rate, TP is the target price of
dai, MP is the market price of dai and SP is the SensitivityParameter.

Hence, when the market price is below the target price, the deflation
rate increases.  This makes it more expensive for DaiBorrowers to
issue new dai (which tends to cause a reduction in the supply of dai).
At the same time, an increased deflation rate also causes CapitalGains
earned by DaiHolders to go up (which tends to cause an increase in the
demand for dai).  This combination of a reduced supply and an
increased demand tends to cause the value of the dai to appreciate,
pushing the market price up towards the target price.

The same mechanism works in reverse if the market price is higher than
the target price: a decreased deflation rate leads to an increased
demand for borrowing and a decreased demand for holding, causing the
dai to depreciate in value, pushing it down towards the target price.

In other words, deflation rate adjustment is a negative FeedbackLoop:
deviation away from the target price in one direction automatically
causes an increase in the force applied in the opposite direction.

The magnitude of the change in deflation rate over time depends on how
long the market price remains on the same side of the target price.
