A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a BlockChain-based
organization whose BusinessLogic is carried out by SmartContracts.

The first example of a DAO is arguably BitCoin.

The EthereumBlockchain was designed to make it easy for developers to
construct new DAOs without having to implement whole new blockchains.
