An asset has "price stability" if it has low ShortTerm and MediumTerm
volatility against some relevant CurrencyBasket or BasketOfGoods.

Achieving price stability is the goal of a StableCoin.

The SpecialDrawingRight (SDR) currency basket (a proxy to the major
world currencies) is the StabilityAnchor for the DaiStablecoin.
