A CollateralizedDebtPosition whose CollateralRatio drops below its
LiquidationRatio is called "risky", and its liquidation can be triggered
by a KeeperAgent.

When a CDP is liquidated, Maker takes over the CdpCollateral and sells
it off in a CollateralAuction.  Simultaneously, the CdpDebt is taken
on by the system (as EmergencyDebt) and extinguished in a DebtAuction.

In order for Maker to take over the collateral so it can be sold off,
emergency debt is instantly used to create dai which is backed by the
ability of Maker to dilute the MkrToken supply (see PrintAndSell).
A ReverseAuction is used to find the lowest amount of MKR that needs
to be printed to raise enough dai to cancel out the emergency debt.
This type of auction is called a debt auction.

Simultaneously to the debt auction, the collateral is sold off
for dai in a collateral auction.  The proceeds of this auction are
sent directly to the BuyAndBurn contract, up to the value of the
emergency debt plus the LiquidationPenalty.  If enough dai is raised
to cover both the debt and the liquidation penalty, then the auction
switches into reverse to sell as little of the collateral as possible.
Any LeftoverCollateral which is freed up in this second phase of the
auction is returned directly to the CdpOwner.

Example 4:

  Assume ETH has a liquidation ratio of 145% and a penalty of 105%,
  and that an ETH-CDP is outstanding at 150% collateral ratio.
  Assume further that the price of ETH crashes 10% against the SDR,
  causing the collateral ratio of the CDP to fall to about 135%.
  As it falls below the liquidation point, traders can trigger its
  liquidation and begin bidding with dai to buy MKR in the debt
  auction.  Traders can also begin bidding with dai to buy the about
  135 dai worth of collateral in the collateral auction.  Once there
  is at least 105 dai is being bid, traders bid in reverse to take the
  least amount of collateral for 105 dai.  The remainder is returned
  to the CDP owner.
