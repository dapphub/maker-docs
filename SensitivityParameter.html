The "sensitivity parameter," sometimes known as the "target rate adjustment,"
is the only global RiskParameter of the DaiCreditSystem.

The sensitivity is defined as the number of percentage points per
day by which to adjust the TargetRate (in the direction determined
by the relationship between the TargetPrice and the DaiMarketPrice).

For example, if the sensitivity is 0.2 pp/day, and the market
price of dai is too low, then if the system were poked after 12 hours,
the dai target rate rate would be increased by 0.1 percentage points.
