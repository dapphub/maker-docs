A "unit of account" is an asset whose PriceStability is such that it
can be used to measure and compare other prices over time.

A FiatCurrency is typically the unit of account for most economic
activity occuring within its corresponding jurisdiction.

While a CryptoCurrency typically makes for a poor unit of account (due
to lack of price stability), StableCoins exist to solve this problem.
