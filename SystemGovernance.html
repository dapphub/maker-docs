Direct governance means controlling MakerDao directly through voting
with an Ethereum account that holds MkrTokens.  An account gets a vote
for each MKR token held.  MKR owners who actively vote and participate
in governance are called governors.  A simple majority vote has full
authority of the system to change the voting rules, alter the business
logic, spend money from the DevelopmentFund, and LockDown Maker's
smart contracts as the system matures.

There are four major phases when governors exercise direct governance
over Maker through the voting process.

* The first phase is deploying and publishing the ActionProposal, a
  smart contract that will change the status quo of Maker if it gets
  executed by directly modifying the state of its smart contracts.

* The second phase is initiating the action proposal for public vote
  by the governors.  This enables governors to vote on the action
  proposal with their MKR and starts the proposal's expiration timer.

* The third phase is the voting process.  Voting is done according to
  the voting rules of the system (themselves modifiable, until they
  are locked down by the governance process).  Each action proposal
  has an expiration time after which it is automatically abandoned.

* The fourth phase is triggering the action.  This is the transaction
  that actually modifies the state of Maker's smart contract system.

Example:

* Informal governance proposal: A new proposal will first be brought
  up and discussed on chat and the forum - in this setting of public
  and freeflowing information a proposal will be rapidly scrutinized
  and any obvious objections will be raised immediately by the
  community.  The proposal can then be amended based on input and
  objections or abandoned.

* Formal governance proposal: Once a proposal has been amended to a
  form that doesn't have any obvious objections, it can move on to
  formal governance.  Formal governance ensures that every governor is
  present to weigh the proposal as it is presented in formal parlance
  that emphasizes the use of simple English with live translation to
  other major languages.  If there is input and objections to the
  proposal, they have to be properly articulated, and if necessary the
  proposal can be delayed until the next GovernanceMeeting to allow
  another week of informal governance.  When a proposal no longer has
  any formal objections or input, an action proposal has to be created
  and published for scrutiny so that governors can ensure that it
  properly implements the spirit of the proposal.

* Direct governance vote: When the action proposal is considered ready
  for vote, it is initiated by the proposer and governors can begin
  the process of voting for or against it.  As mentioned above, the
  initiation has to be done during the governance meeting or it is
  considered either an attack or a governance crisis.  The process of
  voting extends beyond the governance meeting where it was proposed,
  allowing plenty of time for every governor to vote even if they
  weren't present.
