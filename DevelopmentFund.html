The development fund is a SmartContract separate from the core system
that holds money on behalf of MakerDao.

The fund is temporarily controlled by a group of MkrToken owners who
actively participate in SystemGovernance (known as the AlphaDynasty).

The MKR in the fund was initially set aside by the founder of Maker to
facilitate development of the DaiCreditSystem.  The fund may also hold
other EthereumTokens (usually raised by selling MKR from the fund).

As of January 1, 2017, the address of the MultiSig controlling the
development fund is 0x7bb0b08587b8a6b8945e09f1baca426558b0f06a.
