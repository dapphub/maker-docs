Risk parameters are SystemGovernance instruments used to minimize the
need for BailOuts, and in general to ensure that the DaiCreditSystem
remains stable despite the possibility of a variety of contingencies.

Each CdpType has five risk parameters:

 * The DebtCeiling, used to limit risk due to PortfolioImbalance.
 * The LiquidationRatio, used to limit risk due to PriceVolatility.
 * The LiquidationPenalty, used to offset the costs of CdpLiquidation.
 * The LimboDuration, used to manage risk due to PriceFeed failures.
 * The StabilityFee, rewarding MkrToken holders for assuming the risk.

There is also a global risk parameter, known as the SensitivityParameter.
