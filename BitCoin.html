Bitcoin is the original CryptoCurrency.  It can also be considered to
be the first DecentralizedAutonomousOrganization (DAO) and is more or
less synonymous with the idea of a "BlockChain."

Since it lacks PriceStability, it is not a StableCoin.  However, it is
an effective MediumOfExchange and (so far) a pretty good StoreOfValue.

Economists have argued that the PriceBubbles in bitcoin "conclusively
disprove the EfficientMarketHypothesis," since there appears to be no
FundamentalReason for the bitcoin price to be anything in particular.
