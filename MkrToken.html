The EthereumToken which acts as "shares" in MakerDao is called "MKR."
In theory, the MKR price can be expected to correlate with the overall
performance of the DaiCreditSystem.

The initial supply is 1,000,000 MKR.  As of January 1, 2017, a total
of 494,078 MKR are in the hands of founders, investors, developers,
and other people involved with the project.  The other 505,922 MKR
remain in a MultiSig account called the DevelopmentFund.

In return for taking on the risk of BailOuts, owners of the MKR token
earn a StabilityFee on all outstanding DaiStablecoin.  The income from
stability fees is funnelled directly to MKR owners through BuyAndBurn.

However, MKR owners are taking a big risk, since Maker is commited to
acting as a "market maker of last resort" by backing the liquidation
of RiskyCdps through its ability to PrintAndSell MKR tokens.

Only "buy-and-burn" and "print-and-sell" can alter the MkrSupply.
