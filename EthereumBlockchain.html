Ethereum is a BlockChain with TuringComplete scripting that makes it
relatively cheap to develop new DecentralizedAutonomousOrganizations.

While Ethereum is a pure ProofOfWork blockchain, the DifficultyBomb
was put in place to force the developers to migrate to ProofOfStake.

The Ethereum network charges GasCosts denominated in NativeEth (ETH)
to whoever wants to have an EthereumTransaction included in a block.

Examples of DAOs that run on Ethereum include MakerDao and DigixDao.
