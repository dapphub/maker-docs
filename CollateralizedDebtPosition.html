A collateralized debt position (CDP) is a DaiCreditSystem record of
the CdpCollateral posted by the CdpOwner as well as the CdpDebt owed.

Every CDP has a CdpId and belongs to a CdpType.

Borrowing dai is done by "locking" some CollateralTokens in a CDP and
then "issuing" an amount of dai.  This sends the newly issued dai to
the DaiBorrower and records a corresponding amount of debt in the CDP.

Over time, the CDP accrues a StabilityFee added on top of the debt.
The borrower can "free" the posted collateral by "covering" the debt
plus the stability fee.  All stability fees go towards BuyAndBurn.

Example 1: Borrowing dai
  Alice wants to borrow 100 dai.  She locks an amount of ETH worth
  significantly more than 100 dai into a CDP and then issues 100 dai,
  which are instantly sent to her Ethereum account.  If the stability
  fee for this CDP type is 0.75% per year, then one year later Alice
  would need 100.75 dai to cover the debt and retrieve her ETH.

  Background:
    Given ETH1 is a type of CDP backed by ETH
      and the stability fee of ETH1 is 0.75%
      and the price of ETH is 5.34 SDR
      and the target price of dai is 0.73 SDR
      and the liquidation ratio of ETH1 is 150%
      and I am a person called Alice
      and I open a CDP of type ETH1

  Scenario:
    Given I have 1,000 ETH and 500 DAI
     When I lock 25 ETH and issue 100 DAI
     Then I should have 975 ETH and 600 DAI
     When I wait 1 year and close the CDP
     Then I should have 1,000 ETH and 499.25 DAI

  Scenario: Attempting to lock nonexistent collateral
    Given I have 24 ETH
     Then I should not be able to lock 25 ETH
  Scenario: Attempting to borrow against too little collateral
    Given I have 1,000 ETH
     When I lock 20 ETH
     Then I should not be able to issue 100 DAI

The (normally) deflationary nature of the dai means that the market
value of the debt measured in SDR also tends to increase over time;
this adds an additional cost to borrowing, beyond the stability fee.

The DaiDeflation transfers value from DaiBorrowers to DaiHolders,
while the stability fee transfers value from borrowers to MkrOwners.

One of the primary use cases of CDPs is MarginTrading by borrowers.

Example 2: Margin trading
  Bob wishes to go margin long ETH/DAI.  He locks 150 SDR worth of ETH
  and issues 100 SDR worth of dai.  He then buys another 100 SDR worth
  of ETH with the dai he just borrowed.  This puts him at a net 1.66x
  exposure to ETH/SDR.  Of course, he is free to do whatever he wants
  with the ETH he obtained by selling his dai, but the collateral (the
  150 SDR worth of ETH that he locked in the CDP) remains unavailable
  to him until he covers the debt plus stability fees.

Although CDPs are not fungible with each other, the ownership of a CDP
is transferable.  This allows CDPs to be used in smart contracts that
perform more complex methods of borrowing (for example, involving more
than one actor).

Example 3: Multi-party margin trading
  Alice and Bob collaborate using an Ethereum contract to issue 100
  SDR worth of dai backed by ETH.  Alice contributes 50 SDR worth of
  ETH, while Bob contributes 100 SDR worth.  The OTC contract takes
  the funds, creates a CDP and then issues 100 SDR worth of dai.
  The newly borrowed dai are automatically sent to Bob.  (From Bob's
  point of view, he is buying 100 SDR worth of dai by paying the
  equivalent value in ETH.)  The contract then transfers ownership of
  the CDP to Alice.  She now has 100 SDR worth of (dai-denominated)
  debt and 150 SDR worth of (ETH-denominated) collateral.  Since she
  started with only 50 SDR worth of ETH, she is now 3x long ETH/SDR.
