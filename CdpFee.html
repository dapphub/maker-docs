When a CollateralizedDebtPosition that was last poked at time t_[n-1]
is poked at time t_n, the new total CdpDebt is given by

                                   RD(t_n)
             D(t_n) = D(t_[n-1]) -----------,
                                 RD(t_[n-1])

where RD(t_n) and RD(t_[n-1]) are the corresponding ReferenceDebts.
This applies all the compound StabilityFees in a single calculation.

The fee F(t_n) = D(t_n) - D(t_[n-1]) is paid by the CdpOwner, and the
same amount of DaiStablecoin are also created and sent to BuyAndBurn.
