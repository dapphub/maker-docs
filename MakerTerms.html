The MakerSystem is defined by the set of MakerComponents.

The most important MakerComponents are the VatComponent and VowComponent.

The VatComponent contains all the entrypoints to the system, called MakerActions.
This contract is sometimes called the "CDP Engine".

The VowComponent is a contract that enforces the incentives that keep the MakerVat solvent.
This contract is sometimes called the "Settler".

The rest of the MakerComponents are used to protect and coordinate calls to the VatComponent.
For example, the DadComponent is a contract which counts MKR votes to determine when to call `mold`,
while the RatComponent turns multiple input feeds into a "true" feed value with which to `mark`.

MakerActions can be categorized by which MakerRole can access them.
Each MakerRole corresponds 1:1 to one of the MakerComponents,
except LadRole, which simply means "public".
All MakerActions are identified with 4 letter words.

A MakerVariable is a part of the Maker system state.
All MakerVariables are identified by 3 letter words.
Variables are generally classified into Parameters, Feeds, and Automated.

A Gem is a valid ERC20 token.
An Ilk is a CDP type. An ilk has a fixed gem that is not a parameter, feed, or auto variable.
An Urn is a CDP.
