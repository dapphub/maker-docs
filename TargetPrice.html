The "target price" of the DaiStablecoin is used by the DaiCreditSystem
to determine the CollateralRatio of a CollateralizedDebtPosition.

The target price of dai is denominated in SDR (the StabilityAnchor)
and is always changing continuously according to the DeflationRate.

The initial target price will arbitrarily be set to $1 USD equivalent.

Immediately after launch, the target price will slowly start drifting
away from its initial value, maintaining low volatility against the
major world currencies in the ShortTerm (via the anchor to the SDR),
while tending towards slow but steady PriceDeflation in the LongTerm.
