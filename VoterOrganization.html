An important part of SystemGovernance is voter organization.  To make
it as straightforward as possible for governors to coordinate their
votes and discuss ActionProposals, a weekly formal GovernanceMeeting
is held as a conference call using the TeamSpeak platform, currently
(as of September 2016) defined to happen every Sunday at 15:00 GMT.

While the contract system allows initiating proposals for vote at any
time, during normal conditions it is in practice only done at the
governance meeting.  If a proposal is initiated for vote outside the
social framework of the governance meeting, it indicates either an
attack on the system, or a breakdown of the governance framework and a
potential governance crisis.

All governance-related discussion and debate that doesn't take place
in the framework of the governance meeting is referred to as "informal
governance."  The Maker RocketChat server and the MakerForum act as
the primary communications platforms for MkrToken owners to discuss
and debate all aspects of the DAO and its governance, and for
governors to schedule governance meetings.
