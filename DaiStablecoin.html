The "dai" is a StableCoin autonomously managed by the DaiCreditSystem.

It is designed to maintain PriceStability in the ShortTerm (making it
useful as a UnitOfAccount and a MediumOfExchange), and to tend towards
PriceDeflation in the LongTerm (making it a potential StoreOfValue).

The StabilityAnchor of the dai is the SpecialDrawingRight (SDR).
