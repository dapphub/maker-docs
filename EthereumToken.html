A "token" on the EthereumBlockchain is a SmartContract that records
balances and allows transfers between accounts.

If an Ethereum token does not conform to the ERC20 standard, it may be
necessary to create a WrappedToken.  For example, WrappedEth (WETH)
exists only because NativeEth (ETH) itself is not an ERC20 token.

A token functions as a "sub-CryptoCurrency" on top of Ethereum.

Examples: DaiStablecoin, MkrToken
