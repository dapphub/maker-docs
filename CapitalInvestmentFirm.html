Capital investment firms (CIFs) are LegalEntities that specialize in
repackaging legal securities into a format that can be used as
CollateralAssets for borrowing dai, thus enabling the DaiStablecoin to
be backed by off-chain collateral.

CIFs increase the ability of MakerDao to respond to dai DemandShocks
by borrowing dai and trading it for other assets.
