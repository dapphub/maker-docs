Every CollateralizedDebtPosition has an "owner."  While CDPs are not
fungible with each other, they can still be traded (see CdpTransfer).

The CDP owner is entitled to redeem the CdpCollateral after covering
all outstanding CdpDebt (including any incurred StabilityFees).

In case of a profitable CdpLiquidation, the LeftoverCollateral from
the CollateralAuction is automatically sent back to the CDP owner.

The original owner of a CDP is the DaiBorrower.
