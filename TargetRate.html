The "deflation rate" of the DaiStablecoin is defined as an annual rate
of change in the TargetPrice.

The new target price TP' after some time dt is calculated as

                                        sgn(DR) dt
                   TP' = TP * (1 + |DR|),

where TP is the previous target price and DR is the deflation rate.

The change in target price happens continuously and automatically.
In addition, the deflation rate itself is also continuously and
automatically altered in a process known as DeflationAdjustment.
