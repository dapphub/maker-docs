Agents that systematically earn an income from MakerDao by exploiting
simple profit opportunities are called "keepers."  In a general sense,
a keeper is an economic agent (usually automated) that contributes to
DecentralizedAutonomousOrganizations in exchange for built-in rewards.

In the context of Maker, keepers perform several important functions:

 * Participating in ContinuousSplittingAuctions

   Keepers are constantly scanning the blockchain for RiskyCdps that
   can have a CdpLiquidation triggered.  Keepers bid on auctions with
   the goal of getting a price that is better than the market rate so
   that they can instantly sell the earned asset for profit.

 * Market making the dai around the TargetPrice

   Each keeper will want to try to sell dai when the DaiMarketPrice is
   higher than the target price.  Similarly, keepers buy dai when the
   price is below the target in order to profit from the known
   long-term convergence towards the target price and make money from
   the spread.

 * Providing price feeds

   A keeper can also act as an oracle by providing a PriceFeed.
