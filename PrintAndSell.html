The term "print-and-sell" refers to the way DebtAuctions (which are
used to liquidate RiskyCdps) are funded by printing new MkrTokens.

Upon CdpLiquidation, a DebtAuction is used to print just the right
amount of MKR tokens necessary to fully cover the EmergencyDebt.

This happens concurrently to the CollateralAuction, which is used to
raise a corresponding amount of DaiStablecoins used for BuyAndBurn.
