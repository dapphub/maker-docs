An asset is said to be a "store of value" when it can be expected to
maintain its value over the MediumTerm and especially the LongTerm.

Paradigmatic examples of stores of value include PreciousMetals (on
which BitCoin was modelled), RealEstate, and GovernmentBonds.

In theory, the PriceDeflation properties of the DaiStablecoin should
make it a good candidate for preserving value in the long term.
