The "reference debt" or "fee accumulator" of a CdpType is an imaginary
loan of 1 dai, taken out at CDP type creation and left to "accumulate"
the compound StabilityFees applied over the lifetime of the CDP type
(taking into account that the fee can be changed by SystemGovernance).

The reference debt RD(t_n) is computed from its previous value by

                                                  dt
         RD(t_n) = RD(t_[n-1]) * [1 + SF(t_[n-1])],

where SF is the stability fee and dt is the elapsed TimeInYears.
(This computation is nontrivial due to FixedPointExponentiation.)

Previous values may be needed later to determine CdpFees, so each
computed value of the reference debt is recorded in EthereumStorage.

To maintain the correct value, the reference debt also needs to be
recomputed whenever the stability fee of the CDP type is changed.
