A CdpLiquidation is not guaranteed to be profitable, even if triggered
when the CollateralRatio is just below the LiquidationRatio.

For example, a market crash, or simply market slippage, could cause
the CollateralAuction to raise less MkrTokens for BuyAndBurn than the
amount that had to be created by PrintAndSell in the DebtAuction.

In this case, MakerDao sustains a net loss, which means that there is
a corresponding net increase in the outstanding supply of MKR.

Maker uses multiple RiskParameters to ensure that the system remains
stable despite the possibility of unprofitable liquidations.
