Every CdpOwner pays a "stability fee" to MakerDao.  The stability fee
is defined per CdpType as a yearly percentage accrued continuously on
top of the existing debt of each CollateralizedDebtPosition.

The stability fee is a RiskParameter.

Upon poking a CDP, its CdpFee is calculated and added to the CdpDebt.
