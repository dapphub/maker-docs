The Dai Credit System is the SmartContract system used by MakerDao to
generate the PriceStability and PriceDeflation of the DaiStablecoin by
automatic modification of market incentives (via DeflationAdjustment),
and to provide trustless credit services to EthereumBlockchain users.

New dai enter the money supply when a DaiBorrower posts an excess of
collateral to a CollateralizedDebtPosition (CDP) and takes out a loan.
The debt and collateral amounts are recorded in the CDP, and (as time
passes) the StabilityFees incurred by the CdpOwner are also recorded.
The collateral itself is held in a TokenVault controlled by MakerDAO.

Any Ethereum account can borrow dai without any requirements beyond
posting and maintaining adequate collateral.  There are no term limits
on dai loans and borrowers are free to open or close CDPs at any time.
The collateral held in CDPs collectively backs the value of the dai in
a fully transparent manner that anyone can verify.
