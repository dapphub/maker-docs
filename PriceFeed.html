Other than KeeperAgents, another crucial group of ExternalAgents that
MakerDao requires to function are price feed oracles.

Oracles are mechanisms that provide information from the outside world
onto the BlockChain for SmartContracts to consume.

Maker needs information about the DaiMarketPrice (specifically, its
deviation from the TargetPrice) to perform DeflationAdjustment.

It also needs information about the market prices of the various
CollateralTokens, to know when a CdpLiquidation can be triggered.
